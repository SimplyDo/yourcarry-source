Rite in the Rain is a truly amazing paper that is created specifically for writing field notes in all weather conditions; from the torrential downpours of the Pacific Northwest to the blistering heat and humidity of a Florida summer's day. Excellent for boat and dive logs, hiking, student field work and all outdoor occupations.

If the weather is not a big issue you may opt for some trusted [Field Notes](/items/fieldnotes/) instead.
