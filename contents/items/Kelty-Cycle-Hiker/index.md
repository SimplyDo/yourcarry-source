Kelty is goig back to its roots with their vintage line of gear. That does not make the Kelty Cycle Hiker any less useful. Ample space, small form factor and many features to stow away lots of items without making a mess.

They say: Unique 1960's styling with padded adjustable shoulder straps, internal organization, and easy to access pockets ensure that this pack is perfect for everyday, around town use. I agree.

-------------------

I have replaced this pack with a [Rucksack No. 21](/items/fjallraven-rucksack/) by Fjällräven that should easily withstand the next 10 years of daily use and abuse.
